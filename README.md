## What is IITB-RISC?
IITB-RISC is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching that is based on the Little Computer Architecture.
The IITB-RISC-22 is a 16-bit computer system with 8 registers.
It follows the standard 6 stage pipeline:
  1. Instruction fetch
  2. Instruction decode
  3. Register read
  4. Execute
  5. Memory access
  6. Write back
The architecture is optimized for performance using hazard mitigation techniques namely:
  - Forwarding
  - Branch prediction
